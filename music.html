                            I tried to capture the monotonous and trapping feelings of daily life in an exploitative world, and at the same time,
                            the perseverance and will for more, the cry for something better

                        <p class="lead description">This was one of my favorites when I created it, but i've gotten used to it now. While the sound choices are great,
                            I think it lacks a narrative. There should be more distinct sections, and some parts go on for too long. Nevertheless, I always love that part
                            where the synths come together, I'm very proud of the bassline. This was also one of the first times expirementing with orcherstral instruments,
                            i think it went ok.

                            synth and it made a beautiful sound when I held the pedal. Project 48 was born. This was the first project I let myself really experiment with various
                            effects and gradually building them with automation. I love the transitions in the second half.
