                            the perseverance and will for more, the cry for something better

                        <p class="lead description">Project 29 was one of my favorites when I created it, but i've gotten used to it now. While the sound choices are great,
                            I think it lacks a narrative. There should be more distinct sections, and some parts go on for too long. Nevertheless, I always love that part
                            where the synths come together, I'm very proud of the bassline. This was also one of the first times expirementing with orcherstral instruments,
                            i think it went ok.

                        <p class="lead description">Everybody likes this one the best. I get it, it's not too experimental, it's not too mainstream. My inspiration for this
                            was really the sample of the cars, it all started with that. I'm most proud of the synth that comes in after the first chorus. It's probably my
                            favorite thing I've ever produced. It just sounds so good, with its variation changing into the second verse. I wanted the glitch ending to work,
                            but I wanted it to happen a chorus earlier. At the time, I just added an extra verse/chorus pair because I wanted to include the last synths,
                            but looking back, that's something I would probably change to make the song a bit shorter.

                        <p class="lead description">I didn't know what I was making when I started this one. And then I played around with the arpeggiator on that one plucked
                            synth and it made a beautiful sound when I held the pedal. Project 48 was born. This was the first project I let myself really experiment with various
                            effects and gradually building them using automation. I love the transitions in the second half of the song.

                            I was playing with sounds, reversing, expirementing with samples. Now I really like this project, it sounds great, it's unique, and i
                            think it has potential to be something bigger as well.
